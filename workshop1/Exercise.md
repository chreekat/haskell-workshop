# Exercises

*You should do the first exercise in advance.*

## Set up tooling

- Install stack
  `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`

  Stack is updated frequently and manages its own installs, so we recommend
  using this default install method.

  There are others listed in [the
  documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), if you insist.

  - https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#macos
  - https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#installupgrade
- Build the hello world project with `stack build`
- Try out repl `stack repl`
- Try out `stack build --file-watch`  and modifying source files

## Go through hello world

- More to come
